<h1>ðŸ‘¾ Please Read</h1>

<p>This is the start of the project. Akshaj has added a temp README file file for everyone to read.</p>

<p><strong>This is what everyone has to do to complete the project w/o major fuckups to the working files</strong></p>

There is a master branch and a development branch
DO NOT make changes to the master branch

<p>Clone the main repo with</p>

`git clone https://github.com/Shop-N-Split/Shop-N-Split.git`

<p>Start the git process</p>

`git init`

<p>Pull all the contents of the master branch to your local environment</p>
<p>This will update all the files from master on GitHub to the master locally</p>

`git pull origin master`

<p>Once you have the file and stuff done, change the git head to the development branch</p>

`git checkout -b development`

<p>Pull all the updates from development before you start working on it</p>

`git pull origin development`

<p>Once your work is done, you will need to update the contents on the remote. </p>

```
git add .
git commit -m "your comment on what you have done"
git push origin development
```
